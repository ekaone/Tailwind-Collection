# [Tailwind Toolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/) - [Multi Section Form](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/templates/multi-section-form)

[Multi Section Form](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/templates/multi-section-form) is a starting point for a multi section form using scrollspy (e.g. for use as a settings page).  It is created in [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) by [Tailwind Toolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/).

The template uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for scrollspy and the CDN version of [Tailwind Custom Forms](https://github.com/tailwindcss/custom-forms) to style the form fields.
